      This is my first bit of code that I have done in my Intro to Programming
      class, while it's not particularily impressive, it is still the first and
      as such deserves a place here.

    <!-- I had a lot of trouble with this link, if it works for you, great! If it doesn't... 
      I really don't know what happened here, my best guess is some local shenanegins but who knows. 
      All i know is that with the same exact code it didn't work on my computer, but it did on some of my friend's computers. 
      If you see something I didn't then great, because I really don't know why this is happening.-->

    <p class="pg2bodyborder">
      This is my work of code that I am the most proud of, that I was able to
      make 2D and 3D objects interact with eachother, all while looking pleasing
      still makes me pretty happy.

      This one was a little bit of an accident when working with mapping, but it
      turned out nice, and I will always enjoy my time playing with this square.
