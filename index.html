      I have always dabbled in programming from time to time, taking some
      classes in elementary school. Then in middle school I really started to
      pick up my programming career, mainly in robotics. 
      After a few years of robotics I started taking the intro to programming class I am taking now.
      As such, this is a portfolio of the bits of code I've made since then.
